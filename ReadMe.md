# Lite Router

Lite Router is a small Router to get you started without forcing any sort of framework or structure onto your projects.

## Getting Started

You have two main options for getting started with Lite Router.

### Composer

The first is for composer projects. Simply run this command and add the dependency.

`composer require jacobshenning/lite-router`

After that, just include it into the file you wish to use it in.

`use LightRouter\Router;`

### Download

Lite Router is only a single PHP class, so you can download it directly if you wish.

After you download it, simply add the router to your project and include it into your file.
